# Chronos

High-resolution monotonic timer module. Loaded as a require-able library: `local chronos = require('chronos')`.

Uses `QueryPerformanceCounter` on Windows for nanosecond-class precision.

## nanotime

`chronos.nanotime():` **`number`**

Returns the current monotonic time in seconds with nanosecond precision. The returned value is relative to an unspecified epoch — only differences between two calls are meaningful.

```lua
local chronos = require('chronos')

local start = chronos.nanotime()
-- ... work ...
local elapsed = chronos.nanotime() - start
Log.Write("Elapsed: " .. tostring(elapsed) .. " seconds")
```
